		<div class="reference blue-font">[1] Elliot, Andrew J., and Markus A. Maier. "Color-in-context theory." Advances in experimental social psychology. Vol. 45. Academic Press, 2012. 61-125.</div>

		<p>Colors are commonly used in games to represent narrative and usability aspects. However, it is difficult to reach a consensus on the meanings attributed to a color because they are contextual, depending on the associations informed by the game interface and even on the player's previous experiences <sup class="blue-font">[1]</sup>. Besides that, colors are physically perceived differently by everyone, specially in the case of color blind players. Therefore, evaluating issues related to the meaning of colors in games using color blindness simulations is a difficult task.</p>
		<p>It is important that these meaning relationships are observed with players with color blindness.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>PROBLEM SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>Through simulations and guidelines, you were able to identify and solve problems with visualization and differentiation of elements in your game. However, you still feel unsure whether the colors used are sending the correct message so that players with color blindness can understand your game.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Our sudies have shown that, when presented with a color in the context of a game and two alternative meanings, participants rarely agree on the meaning attributed to that color. Furthermore, in some situations, the interpretations of players with color blindness and players with typical vision (using color blindness simulation) tend to have opposite meanings.</p>

		<p>Even though the meaning of different hues are difficul to control, brightness appear to be a good asset to convey meaning. It was observed that lighter colors attract more attention from players and tend to be associated with more positive meanings.</p>

		<img src="img/recom9.png">

		<p>The fruits shown in the image above were used in out studies: the red fruit was good while the yellow fruit made the player sick. When applying the protanopia simulation, the fruits start to have a similar hue, being differentiated only by their brightness. Both participants with color blindness and participants with typical vision (using color blindness simulation) reported that they got confused and collected some bad fruits because it looked lighter and brighter than the good fruit.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>USE SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You are developing a game and decided to use color blindness simulations to improve color accessibility. During inspections, you suspect that meanings were assigned to some colors during design that may not be understood by players with color blindness. During testing with these players, you observe whether problems appear in parts of the game that use these colors. Furthermore, in an interview, you explore the participants' opinion about the colors used and, if a problem is identified, you look for possibilities to improve color accessibility with the player.</p>
		</div>

		<h1>TIPS</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Try to identify areas of the interface in advance where the meaning of colors is important for understanding some information. You can use color blindness simulations to help with this activity.</li>
			<li>Consult gamers with color blindness about the general feeling that the game interface gives them and compare it with the feeling intended by the designers. If they are completely different, consider making adjustments to the color palette or even the shape of game elements to reinforce the intended feeling.</li>
		</ul>



		<h1>WHAT NOT TO DO</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Avoid assigning meaning to colors. If this is not possible, offer other ways of transmitting the same information without using colors.</li>
			<li>Do not draw conclusions about the meaning of the colors in your games through the use of color blindness simulations. These tools can be used to identify points of attention, but as the attribution of meaning is very contextual, it is not safe to make decisions on this matter without consulting players with color blindness.</li>
