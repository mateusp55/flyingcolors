		<p class="rec-title yellow-font"><strong>2.</strong> Training is necessary, but don't wait to be an expert to get started</p>
	
		<p>Accessibility is a complex area and there is a lot to learn. Even just thinking about the accessibility of colors, a lot must be taken into consideration since there are different types of color blindness and the intensity varies from person to person. However, you have to start somewhere.</p>

		<p>Color blindness simulations are cheap and simple tools to use. As a result, they allow greater freedom to experiment. Furthermore, they can help with your studies, as it is possible to visualize the effects of color blindness in your creations in real time.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>PROBLEM SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You are creating a game and would like to consider color accessibility during the development process. You've heard about the use of color blindness simulations (and even seen that they are available in the program you use to create interfaces) but don't know where to start. In general, you don't feel qualified enough to create an accessible game.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="reference yellow-font">* <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/summary-of-usability-inspection-methods/" target="_blank">Usability inspection</a> is a generic name given to evaluation methods that involve the analysis of an interface, typically with a focus on identifying usability problems. But weren't we talking about accessibility? Usability and Accessibility go hand in hand: an easy-to-use system is also a more accessible system. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accessibility-is-not-enough/" target="_blank">Read more about this here.</a></div>
		<p>You can start by inspecting<strong class="yellow-font">*</strong> your game using a simulation tool. Experiments indicate that even designers and developers with little experience in HCI and accessibility are able to identify serious accessibility issues that could prevent colorblind players from playing games by inspecting game interfaces using colorblind simulations. </p>

		<p>Results also highlight that more experienced professionals are able to identify more detailed and subtle problems. In other words, as time goes by and as you deepen your studies, your inspections tend to improve.</p>

		<div class="note-yellow">
			<p>Simulations only <strong>approximate</strong> the experience a colorblind person would have playing your game. The objective is to have indications of the product's chromatic accessibility, not absolute truths.</p>
		</div>
		

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>USE SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You and your team are ideveloping a game for mobile devices. You already have an initial playable prototype and you decide to test it using the native Android operating system simulations. Additionally, you select a group of game accessibility guidelines to guide your problem identification. You play a few cycles of the game with the simulation of each of the types of color blindness that are available. During these palytests, you take notes. At the end of the inspection, you discover that part of the main mechanic is dependent on colors and that this makes the game much more difficult when you cannot differentiate between them. You show the problem areas you identified to other team members who, having more experience, can identify other problems. After that, you seek to create alternatives to guarantee access for players with color blindness to the main mechanics of the game.</p>
		</div>

		<h1>TIPS</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Study the set of accessibility guidelines for games you choose before starting to use simulations. This will give you a clearer idea of what to look for during inspections. Read more about this subject in <a href="rec3.html">Recommendation 3</a>.</li>
			<li>Invite other members of your team to carry out the inspection in parallel. Thus, when comparing the problems found, you will have richer results.</li>
			<li>In the initial stages of the process, try to identify mainly whether the game mechanics depend on colors.</li>
			<li>Don't wait! Unlike methodologies that rely on user participation, which require greater planning, the use of simulations is simple and can be integrated into your everyday routine. Consult the simulations whenever you have a question or want to test something.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>WHAT NOT TO DO</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't think that just evaluations carried out through simulations are enough to guarantee a good experience for players with color blindness. Simulations are powerful tools, but it is importante to include players during your game development process. A combined use of these two approaches is encouraged (see more on this in <a href="rec8.html">Recommendation 8</a>).</a></li>
