		<p>Color accessibility issues identified with color blindness simulations and guidelines are important starting points for making a game more accessible. They can help define the focus of your research with players with color blindness (see <a href="rec8.html">recommendation 8</a>). However, it is recommended that these problems, even if cosmetic <sup class="pink-font">[1]</sup>, are resolved before moving on to the next steps. </p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>PROBLEM SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You and your team identified some color accessibility problems during the development of your game with the help of color blindness simulations and guidelines. As a next step, you want to plan an evaluation with players with color blindness. However, you don't know what to do with the problems already registered.</p>

		<p>In player testing, removing the most obvious issues can help identify new issues. We tested the identification of chromatic accessibility problems in a mobile game prototype and 90% of participants with color blindness indicated at least one accessibility problem that had not been predicted by the researchers. Furthermore, resolving problems early prevents your project from acumulating technical debt <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>USE SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You and your team have identified some issues in your game through the use of color blindness simulations and guidelines. This problem ranges from cosmetic issues to serious issues with core mechanics. With the tests with colorblind players approaching, you will make changes to the interface in order to resolve the identified issues. To do this, you use the guidelines and simulations as a guide. By removing these more obvious issues, players with color blindness were able to identify issues and suggest improvements in details that were not observed with the simulations. In addition, players also suggested improvements to the changes already made to the interface.</p>
		</div>

		<h1>TIPS</h1>

		

		<ul>
			<li>Don't leave cosmetic problems to be resolved later. They can accumulate and end up becoming a bigger and more difficult problem to solve in the future.</li>
			<li>Use color blindness simulations and guidelines to make changes to the interface that resolve or minimize the identified problems.</li>
			<li>Be flexible with changes made to resolve color accessibility issues. You must be able make changes based on the input from players with color blindness.</li>
