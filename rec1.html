		<p class="rec-title yellow-font"><strong>1.</strong> Use color blindness simulations to introduce the accessibility discourse in your team's day-to-day</p>
	
		<p>Understanding the importance and impact of considering accessibility in the process of creating a game is an important first step towards making it a reality. In the case of color accessibility, a clear and personal experience such as that provided by a color blindness simulation can be an interesting tool for this purpose. In addition to introducing designers and developers to some limitations that may occur during gameplay due to color blindness, the use of simulations can also serve as a starting point for the topic of accessibility as a whole to be discussed over time.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>PROBLEM SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You are part of a game creation team that does not usually consider accessibility in its projects. You want to introduce the subject during meetings but don't know how because it seems distant from your reality and that of your colleagues. Furthermore, with the large number of demands, you feel that this matter will not be made a priority.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Designers and developers were impressed by the impact of color vision deficiency on the experience when playing mobile game prototypes using color blindness simulations during experiments. Participants reported having to concentrate much more and some even felt unable to finish the game session.</p>

		<p>This impact was especially significant when using immersive simulations (virtual and augmented reality), where not only the device's screen receives the color filter but also the entire surrounding environment.</p>

		<div class="note-yellow">
			<p>In many countries, <strong>accessibility is a right guaranteed by Law</strong>. It is the duty of game designers and developers to ensure, to the best of their abilities, inclusive experiences.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>USE SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>During a meeting, you propose an activity with the team: play some of the games you developed using a color blindness simulation. You use virtual reality glasses compatible with Google Cardboard and an augmented reality simulation. You ask that each team member tries to identify if there were points in which the simulation made the gameplay difficult. Each participant plays and comments on the experience. At the end, you discuss the experience and talk about possibilities of considering color accessibility during the process used by the team.</p>
		</div>

		<h1>TIPS</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bring general information about accessibility and color blindness that contextualizes the team. You can find some relevant information here.</li>
			<li>If possible, suggest that the team uses simulations by playing games they produced themselves, in order to create a more personal experience that is close to reality.</li>
			<div class="reference yellow-font">[1] Sá, Rafael Avilar, et al. "SDO: Simulador de Doenças Oculares." Anais Estendidos do XXVI Simpósio Brasileiro de Sistemas Multimídia e Web. SBC, 2020.</div>
			<li>Use an immersive simulation to foster engagement. SDO <sup class="yellow-font">[1]</sup> is an augmented reality simulator that is available for free download for Android devices. To make the best use of it, you will also need virtual reality glasses compatible with Google Cardboard.</li>
			<li>The experience of using simulations for the first time is richer in groups. Encourage everyone's participation and ask questions that motivate discussion (e.g.: Did you think that playing with the simulation made the game more difficult? Looking at the game through this filter, what would you change to make the experience for people with color blindness more comfortable?).</li>
			<li>Discuss with your team the possibility of adapting the design process to accommodate color accessibility techniques.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>WHAT NOT TO DO</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be careful not to sound ableist. Remember that the correct term to use is Person with Disability (PWD) or, more specifically, Person with Color Blindness. Disabilities are not something you “have” or “carry”, it is an existential condition of the person. <a href="https://www.accessliving.org/newsroom/blog/ableism-101/" target="_blank">You can read more about ableism here.</a></li>
