		<p class="rec-title pink-font"><strong>3.</strong> Use color blindness simulations in combination with game accessibility guidelines</p>

		<div class="reference pink-font">* <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/summary-of-usability-inspection-methods/" target="_blank">Usability inspection</a> is a generic name given to evaluation methods that involve the analysis of an interface, typically with a focus on identifying usability problems. But weren't we talking about accessibility? Usability and Accessibility go hand in hand: an easy-to-use system is also a more accessible system. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accessibility-is-not-enough/" target="_blank">Read more about this here.</a>
		<br/><br/>**They can be created by academia and industry and seek to inform and guide designers and developers in creating better and more appropriate products. There are guidelines sets on many different topics. Regarding accessibility, one of the main and most complete sets is WCAG. It not only presents guidelines for creating accessible web products, but also very specific success criteria for each of its guidelines. You can find a list of accessibility guidelines for games <a href="materials.html">here</a>.</div>	
		<p>Color blindness simulations enable designers and developers with typical vision to identify color accessibility issues in games empirically. However, the results of inspection assessments<strong class="pink-font">*</strong> using simulations can be enhanced and enriched with the help of heuristics and guidelines<strong class="pink-font">**</strong>.</p>

		<p>These guidelines are created based on studies and previous experiences of experts. Take advantage of this available knowledge to guide the development of your game.</p>

		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>PROBLEM SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You applied a color blindness simulation to your game and thought: "okay, now what?" You started exploring the game but didn't know exactly what kind of problems you should look for, let alone what to do with the problems you identified.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="reference pink-font">[1] Choo, Kenny Tsu Wei, Rajesh Krishna Balan, and Youngki Lee. "Examining augmented virtuality impairment simulation for mobile app accessibility design." Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. 2019.</div>

		<p>Our study have explored the isolated use of color blindness simulations as tools to identify color accessibility issues in games. Despite the positive results, it was observed that knowing what types of problems could be found and where to look for them could have increased the effectiveness of participants in the proposed activity. This combined perspective has shown good results in similar works <sup class="pink-font">[1]</sup>.</p>

		<p>This becomes apparent when, in interviews, participants stated that they did not “pay attention” to certain areas of the interface because they did not know that they could identify problems there (e.g.: visual feedback from the game).</p>


		<div class="scenario">
			<h1>USE SCENARIO</h1>

			<p>You and your team decide to carry out an inspection with color blindness simulations on a playable prototype of the game you are developing. You decide to use Android's native color blindness simulations and the <a href="https://accessible.games/accessible-player-experiences/" target="_blank">Accessible Player Experience (APX)</a> guidelines. You study the guidelines and define a list of areas to inspect in the game interface. Each evaluator individually uses the simulation to play and identify points in the game where the colors used can cause problems for players with color blindness. For each problem identified, the evaluator records a brief description, the location on the interface where the problem occurs, which guideline was broken and the severity level of the problem. In the end, evaluators consolidate the results by comparing their lists of identified problems and resolving differences between them. After that, with the help of guidelines and color blindness simulations, you seek to create more accessible alternatives to the identified problems, which will be tested in subsequent steps of the process with players with color blindness.</p>
		</div>

		<h1>TIPS</h1>

		

		<ul>
			<li>Study the set of accessibility guidelines for games you choose before starting to use simulations. This will give you a clearer idea of what to look for during inspections. Read more about this subject in <a href="rec3.html">Recommendation 3</a>.</li>
			<li>Write down a brief description of each identified problem and the area of the interface in which it is found.</li>
			<li>Record what guideline was broken by each problem identified. This will help to resolve it in the future, as most accessibility guidelines already provide guidance on how the problem can be resolved or minimized.</li>
			<div class="reference pink-font">[2] Nielsen, Jakob. "Usability inspection methods." Conference companion on Human factors in computing systems. 1994.</div>
			<li>Classify identified problems by severity. This will help you prioritize the resolution of identified problems. There are scales created especially for this purpose, such as the  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/" target="_blank">Nielsen Scale</a> <sup class="pink-font">[2]</sup>.</li>
			<li>Use a simulation that allows you to easily switch between filters for different types of color blindness and also allows you to view the original version of the interface without filters (more information in <a href="rec5.html">Recommendation 5</a>). Comparing these different views can help you identify problems that would not be identified otherwise.</li>
			<li>In the initial stages of the process, try to identify mainly whether the game mechanics depend on colors.</li>
			<li>Don't wait! Unlike methodologies that rely on user participation, which require greater planning, the use of simulations is simple and can be integrated into your everyday routine. Consult the simulations whenever you have a question or want to test something.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>WHAT NOT TO DO</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't overcomplicate it. Inspection with simulations is a low-cost and simple method to carry out. Use the resources that are available. For example, if you don't have access to other professionals to carry out the inspection with you, do it yourself. Or if you would like to simulate color blindness in the game on a smartphone but only have access to the prototype game that runs on the desktop, inspect whichever version is available. You will be able to review the identified problems and even identify others in future versions.</li>
			<li>Don't think that just evaluations carried out through simulations are enough to guarantee a good experience for players with color blindness. Simulations are powerful tools, but it is importante to include players during your game development process. A combined use of these two approaches is encouraged (see more on this in <a href="rec8.html">Recommendation 8</a>).</a></li>
